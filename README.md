A modern recreation of the 2007 Scrutinizer vision-simulating browser, built with Electron and the Canvas API, and positioned as a **design constraint model** for studying foveal vs. peripheral vision on the web.

**Original project:** https://github.com/andyed/scrutinizer  


## What is Scrutinizer?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Vision is not a camera feed. It is a controlled hallucination.**
>
> We assume we see the world in high-definition 180° video. We don't. The human eye is a biological scanner with a terrifyingly narrow bandwidth.

### The Reality

> [!NOTE]
> **Foveal Vision (The "What")**
> You only possess "20/20 vision" in the **Fovea**—a tiny patch of retina roughly the size of your thumb held at arm's length (~2° of visual field).
>
> **Peripheral Vision (The "Where")**
> Everything else is the **Periphery**: a low-resolution, color-blind, motion-sensitive sensor that doesn't "see" objects, but merely guesses at their textures.

Your brain stitches these jittery, low-fidelity snapshots into a seamless timeline, editing out the blurs and blackouts in real-time. You are effectively blind to detail for 98% of your visual field.

### What Scrutinizer Does

Scrutinizer strips away the brain's post-processing to reveal the raw data your optic nerve actually receives.

1.  **Foveal Simulation**: A precise window of high-acuity focus that follows your cursor.
2.  **Peripheral Mongrels**: Uses "texture synthesis" algorithms to simulate **Visual Crowding**—where text and shapes disintegrate into statistical noise outside the center.
3.  **Rod-Weighted Luminance**: Simulates the spectral sensitivity of peripheral rod cells, revealing why "Aqua" buttons glow while red text vanishes.

> [!TIP]
> **Designers & Engineers**: Stop designing for the "Screenshot." Start designing for the **Scan**. If your interface doesn't work in Scrutinizer, your users aren't seeing it—they are just hallucinating that they did.

## Features

### Demo Video

[![Watch the demo video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lfROtjCp7bg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfROtjCp7bg)

> [!TIP]
> **New in 2025: Neural Processing Model**
> We've replaced the old optical blur with a biologically-accurate "Box Sampling with Noise" model:
> - **Parafoveal Jitter**: High-contrast but spatially uncertain (simulates crowding)
> - **Peripheral Block Sampling**: Pixelated/mosaic effect (simulates sparse photoreceptor density)
> - **Rod Sensitivity**: Cyan/Aqua elements glow in the periphery (505nm peak)

- � **Binocular foveal mask** that follows your mouse cursor with distinctive 16:9 shape
- �🎨 **Progressive desaturation** with real-time radial gradient (color → grayscale)
- 🧬 **ColorMatrix luminance weights** preserved for accurate grayscale conversion
- 📜 **Scroll detection** with automatic recapture
- 🔄 **DOM mutation detection** for dynamic content
- ⌨️ **Keyboard shortcuts** (Alt+Space to toggle, Alt+wheel to adjust size)
- 🎚️ **Menu-based controls** for radius and blur presets
- ⚡ **Web Worker** for non-blocking blur computation

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the application
npm start
```

## Usage

1. **Navigate**: Enter a URL in the address bar and click **Go**
2. **Enable**: Click the eye icon or press `Space` to toggle foveal mode
3. **Adjust**:
   - Use the **View → Foveal Radius** menu to pick a radius preset
   - Use **View → Blur Amount** to adjust peripheral blur
   - Or hold `Alt` and use the **mouse wheel** while foveal mode is enabled
4. **Observe**: Watch how easily key elements can be located using mostly peripheral vision

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Toggle foveal mode on/off |
| `Escape` | Disable foveal mode |
| `Alt` + `Scroll` | Adjust foveal radius |

## Limitations

> [!WARNING]
> Scrutinizer is intentionally **approximate** and should be used as a **design constraint model**, not a precise physiological instrument.

- It models **retinal input constraints**, not the brain's transsaccadic integration.
- **Current implementation** uses Box Sampling with Noise, not full "Mongrel Theory" texture synthesis.
- It assumes a fixed relationship between screen pixels and **visual angle**.
- **Saccadic suppression** (blindness during eye movements) is not simulated.
- **Chromatic aberration** (R/B channel splitting) not yet implemented.

**Future development** (see `ROADMAP.md`) includes full Mongrel Theory implementation and WebGL-based domain warping.

## Technical Details

### How does it work?

The software captures a bitmap of the page, blurs and desaturates it. The overlay is placed on top of the web page with a foveal sized mask enabling see through wherever the mouse is located.

### Electron Architecture

This implementation leverages Electron's unique capabilities to interact with browser content:

#### Webview Tag
We use Electron's [`<webview>` tag](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/webview-tag) to embed a fully-functional browser within the application. The webview is an isolated browser context that can load any web page while remaining sandboxed from the parent application.

#### IPC Communication
To track mouse movements and page events within the webview, we use Electron's **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**:

1. **Injecting Code**: Using `webview.executeJavaScript()`, we inject tracking code into the loaded page
2. **Sending Events**: The injected code uses `ipcRenderer.sendToHost()` to send mouse coordinates, scroll events, and DOM mutations back to the parent
3. **Receiving Events**: The parent listens via `webview.addEventListener('ipc-message')` to receive these events

#### Image Processing Pipeline

```
DOM → html2canvas → Rod-Sensitive Desaturation → Neural Processing → Foveal Mask → Render
                                                 ├─ Parafoveal: Jitter (crowding)
                                                 ├─ Near Periphery: Fractal Noise (shimmer)
                                                 └─ Far Periphery: Block Sampling + Warping
```
